# Data-Science-Journey

# 📘 Data Science Journey

Welcome to my **Data Science Journey** repository!  
This is my personal learning log as I explore Data Science, Machine Learning, and Python.

---

## 📅 How I Use This Repo

Each folder contains topic-wise notes, code samples, and explanations I write in my own words as I learn. This helps me build strong fundamentals and revision material.

---

## 📌 Why I Built This

- To track my learning journey
- To build discipline through daily/weekly contributions
- To create a portfolio of real understanding (not just tutorials)
