# ðŸ“Š Introduction to Pandas

Pandas is a powerful open-source Python library used for data analysis and manipulation. It is built on top of NumPy and provides easy-to-use data structures like:

- **Series**: One-dimensional labeled arrays.
- **DataFrame**: Two-dimensional labeled data structures (like a spreadsheet or SQL table).

Pandas allows you to:
- Load and explore datasets from various sources (CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.)
- Clean, filter, and transform data efficiently
- Perform complex data analysis and aggregations with minimal code
