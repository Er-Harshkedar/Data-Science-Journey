## 🐍 Why Python for Data Science?

Python is preferred over many other languages in data science because of its simplicity, readability, and vast ecosystem of libraries. 

One major advantage is that **Python is an interpreted language**, meaning it does not need to be compiled before running. This makes it ideal for quick testing, data exploration, and interactive analysis — all of which are essential in data science workflows.
