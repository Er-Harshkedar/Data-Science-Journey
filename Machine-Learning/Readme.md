# 🤖 Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)

**Machine Learning** is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Instead of writing rules manually, we feed data to algorithms that **learn patterns** and make decisions or predictions.

## 🚀 Why Use Machine Learning?

- Automate repetitive tasks
- Predict outcomes (e.g., stock prices, sales, churn)
- Detect patterns (e.g., fraud, anomalies)
- Power applications (e.g., recommendation systems, chatbots)

## 🧠 Types of Machine Learning

| Type              | Description                                     | Example                       |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Supervised        | Learns from labeled data                        | Spam detection, price prediction |
| Unsupervised      | Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data         | Customer segmentation, clustering |
| Reinforcement     | Learns by trial and error (reward system)       | Self-driving cars, game bots     |

## ⚙️ ML Workflow (Supervised Learning)

1. **Collect Data** – Use CSV, databases, APIs, etc.
2. **Preprocess Data** – Clean, transform, and scale data.
3. **Split Data** – Train/Test split (e.g., 80/20).
4. **Train Model** – Fit a model on training data.
5. **Evaluate Model** – Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.
6. **Improve & Deploy** – Tune, save, and use in real-world apps.

## 🧰 Common ML Libraries

- `scikit-learn`: Most commonly used ML library in Python.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- `NumPy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn`: For visualizations.
- `joblib` or `pickle`: For saving/loading trained models.
