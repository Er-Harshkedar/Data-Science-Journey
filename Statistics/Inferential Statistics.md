## Population vs Sample

- **Population**: The entire group you want to draw conclusions about.  
  Example: All people living in India.

- **Sample**: A subset of the population selected for analysis.  
  Example: 1,000 randomly selected people from India.

## Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

The Central Limit Theorem says that as the sample size increases (typically n ‚â• 30), the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution ‚Äî even if the population is not normal.

### Key Points:
- Mean of the sample means ‚âà population mean  
  Œº‚ÇìÃÑ = Œº

- Standard deviation of the sample means (standard error):  
  œÉ‚ÇìÃÑ = œÉ / ‚àön

### Why It Matters:
- Allows use of normal distribution tools
- Enables construction of confidence intervals
- Supports hypothesis testing

### Example:
If you repeatedly take random samples of 100 students and calculate their average height, those averages will form a bell-shaped curve ‚Äî even if individual heights are not normally distributed.

## üìå Confidence Intervals

### ‚úÖ Definition
A **confidence interval** gives a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter (like mean or proportion) with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%).

---

### ‚úÖ Interpretation
A 95% confidence interval means **we are 95% confident that the true population parameter lies within this interval**.

---

### ‚úÖ Formula (Population Mean, Known œÉ)

CI = xÃÑ ¬± Z * (œÉ / ‚àön)

- `xÃÑ`: sample mean  
- `Z`: Z-score (e.g., 1.96 for 95% confidence)  
- `œÉ`: population standard deviation  
- `n`: sample size


---

### ‚úÖ Formula (Population Mean, Unknown œÉ)
CI = xÃÑ ¬± t * (s / ‚àön)


- `t`: t-score (based on degrees of freedom)  
- `s`: sample standard deviation

---

### ‚úÖ Example

Suppose:
- Sample mean height = 170 cm  
- Sample standard deviation (s) = 10 cm  
- Sample size (n) = 100  
- Confidence level = 95% ‚Üí Z = 1.96

CI = 170 ¬± 1.96 * (10 / ‚àö100)
= 170 ¬± 1.96
= (168.04 cm, 171.96 cm)


We are 95% confident that the average height of the population lies between **168.04 cm and 171.96 cm**.

## üìå Hypothesis Testing

### ‚úÖ Definition
**Hypothesis Testing** is a statistical method used to make decisions or inferences about a population based on sample data.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Terminologies

- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):**  
  A statement that there is no effect or no difference.  
  Example: "The average salary of employees is ‚Çπ50,000."

- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):**  
  A statement that contradicts the null.  
  Example: "The average salary is not ‚Çπ50,000."

- **Significance Level (Œ±):**  
  The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. Common values are 0.05, 0.01.

- **P-value:**  
  The probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming H‚ÇÄ is true.

---

### ‚úÖ Types of Tests

1. **Z-test**:  
   Used when population variance is known and sample size is large.

2. **T-test**:  
   Used when population variance is unknown and sample size is small.

3. **Chi-square test**:  
   Used for categorical data to assess goodness-of-fit or independence.

4. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**:  
   Used to compare means of three or more groups.

---

### ‚úÖ Steps in Hypothesis Testing

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Choose the significance level (Œ±).
3. Select the appropriate test and calculate the test statistic.
4. Find the critical value or p-value.
5. Make a decision:  
   - If p-value ‚â§ Œ± ‚Üí Reject H‚ÇÄ  
   - If p-value > Œ± ‚Üí Fail to reject H‚ÇÄ

---

### ‚úÖ Example

You want to test if the average delivery time of a food service is 30 minutes.

- H‚ÇÄ: Œº = 30  
- H‚ÇÅ: Œº ‚â† 30  
- Sample mean = 28, s = 4, n = 25  
- Use t-test since œÉ unknown and n < 30

t = (xÃÑ - Œº) / (s / ‚àön)
= (28 - 30) / (4 / ‚àö25)
= -2 / 0.8 = -2.5


Compare t with critical t-value for Œ± = 0.05 ‚Üí decide to reject or not reject H‚ÇÄ.

## üìå Types of Errors in Hypothesis Testing

### ‚úÖ Overview
When we perform hypothesis testing, there is always a risk of making an incorrect decision. These risks are classified into two types of errors:

---

### ‚úÖ Type I Error (False Positive)

- **Definition**: Rejecting the null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ) when it is actually true.
- **Probability**: Denoted by **Œ±** (alpha), which is the significance level.
- **Example**: Convicting an innocent person.

> **Interpretation**: You concluded there is an effect when there isn't one.

---

### ‚úÖ Type II Error (False Negative)

- **Definition**: Failing to reject the null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ) when it is actually false.
- **Probability**: Denoted by **Œ≤** (beta).
- **Example**: Letting a guilty person go free.

> **Interpretation**: You missed detecting a real effect.

---

### ‚úÖ Power of a Test

- **Definition**: The probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.
- **Formula**:  
Power = 1 - Œ≤
