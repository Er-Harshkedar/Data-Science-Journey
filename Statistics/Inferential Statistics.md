## Population vs Sample

- **Population**: The entire group you want to draw conclusions about.  
  Example: All people living in India.

- **Sample**: A subset of the population selected for analysis.  
  Example: 1,000 randomly selected people from India.

## Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

The Central Limit Theorem says that as the sample size increases (typically n ≥ 30), the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution — even if the population is not normal.

### Key Points:
- Mean of the sample means ≈ population mean  
  μₓ̄ = μ

- Standard deviation of the sample means (standard error):  
  σₓ̄ = σ / √n

### Why It Matters:
- Allows use of normal distribution tools
- Enables construction of confidence intervals
- Supports hypothesis testing

### Example:
If you repeatedly take random samples of 100 students and calculate their average height, those averages will form a bell-shaped curve — even if individual heights are not normally distributed.
