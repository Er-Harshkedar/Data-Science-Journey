# 📊 Discrete Uniform Distribution

## What is a Discrete Uniform Distribution?

A **Discrete Uniform Distribution** is a probability distribution where **each outcome in a finite set of possible outcomes is equally likely**. That is, if there are `n` possible outcomes, each outcome has a probability of `1/n`.

This is one of the simplest probability distributions and is often used in theoretical studies or in games of chance.

## 🎯 Characteristics

- Each outcome is **equally likely**.
- The set of outcomes is **finite and countable**.
- The probability mass function (PMF) is constant over all values.

## 📘 Probability Mass Function (PMF)

For a discrete uniform distribution with values:

\[
x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n
\]

The PMF is:

P(X = xi) = 1 / n for i = 1, 2, ..., n

## 🧮 Example

**Rolling a fair 6-sided die**

Possible outcomes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  
Each number has an equal chance of appearing:

P(X = x) = 1 / 6 for x = 1 to 6

## 📏 Mean and Variance

For a discrete uniform distribution with values \( a, a+1, ..., b \):

- **Mean**:
  
  μ = (a + b) / 2

- **Variance**:  

  σ² = [(b - a + 1)^2 - 1] / 12

## 🧠 Applications

- Games of chance (dice, cards)
- Random selection from a fixed list
- Simulation and modeling of equally likely events

---

## ✅ Summary

- Discrete uniform distribution is simple but powerful.
- All outcomes are equally likely.
- Easy to compute probabilities, mean, and variance.
